# Williams College Development Theme
Next iteration of departmental theme for Williams College, fully responsive and WCAG2.1 accessible, 
utilizing the Twig/Timber templating engine to separate presentation from logic, the Beaver Builder 
templating engine with custom modules, Webpack, FacetWP, and Subtheme modules which replace 
child themes thus reducing file system complexity and debt.

**Please note:** the [Beaver Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) and Beaver Themer plugins are required for this theme.
